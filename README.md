# DW2Digivolver
Make your Digimon Wolrd 2 gameplay a lot easier.

## Description
DW2 Digivolver is a JAVA developed software that aims to facilitate the creation of your Digimon Wolrd 2 team throughout the game. The software tries to create a friendly interface for the user to discover the easier ways to get a wanted Digimon via the DNA Digivolution system using an extensive database.

On future work, the software is to be updated to become a full support tool for playing Digimon World 2, extending the database to cover Skills, Stages, Items and more.

## Credits
All the DNA tables were extracted from Froste's DNA Digivolution Guide, which can be accessed at http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps/437339-digimon-world-2/faqs/61067. All the digivolutions and DPs were extracted from Rena Chan's Digivolving Guide, which can also be accessed at http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps/437339-digimon-world-2/faqs/11515. All the tables were adapted to be usable in the program, some data was modified. The data contained inside the tables **does not** fall under the MIT license, since each guide creator licensed it differently. Thank you for using it!
